# AQI-Trends-India
Data analysis project exploring AQI trends, health impacts, and EV adoption in India using Microsoft Excel, Power Pivot, and Data Modelling.

🌍 Conducting Market Fit Research for Air Purifier Development Using AQI Analytics

📌 Domain: Consumer Appliances

📌 Function: Market Research & Analytics

📌 Company Context: AirPure Innovations

📝 Problem Statement:

AirPure Innovations is a startup addressing the air quality crisis in India, where 14 of the world’s top 20 most polluted cities are located. Before committing to production and R&D of their air purifier product, the company needed to assess:

📌 Which pollutants should be targeted?

📌 What features are most essential for an effective air purifier?

📌 Which cities have the highest demand potential, and what is the market size?

📌 How can R&D align with localized pollution patterns?
 
 🎯 Project Objectives achieved:

📌 Conducted AQI analysis (2022–2025) across Indian cities.

📌 Identified top pollutants, worst-affected cities, and health impacts.

📌 Compared AQI trends between weekdays vs weekends and metro vs Tier-2 cities.

📊 Data Sources:

📌 AQI Data (2022–2025)

📌 Health Data (2022–2025)

📌 Population Data (2024 estimates)

📌 Vehicle & EV Adoption Data (2022–2025)

📌 Supporting Documents from Dataful

📌 Key Analyses & Insights
1️⃣ Severity Mapping

Identified Top 5 and Bottom 5 polluted areas (Dec 2024 – May 2025).

Highlighted seasonal AQI spikes → winters consistently worse.

2️⃣ Pollutant Mapping

South India → PM2.5 & Ozone dominant.

North India → PM10 & NO2 dominant.

3️⃣ Metro City Trends

Weekends generally show slightly better AQI in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru.

Kolkata & Hyderabad show negligible difference between weekends and weekdays.

4️⃣ Health Impact

Respiratory diseases (Asthma, Bronchitis) and Cardiovascular illnesses are the top 2 reported across states.

Higher AQI values correlate strongly with spikes in these illnesses.

5️⃣ EV Adoption & AQI

States with higher EV adoption (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra) show slightly better AQI averages.

However, high-density urban centers still experience severe pollution.
